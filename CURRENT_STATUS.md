## ⚠️ Known Issues

### Test Failures (Expected)
- **Current Pass Rate:** 4.7% (3/64 tests)
- **Root Cause:** Tests need `data-testid` attributes on components
- **Status:** Infrastructure phase complete, selector fixes needed

### Minor Issues
- Some tests use generic selectors (text match) - need to use test IDs
- Lightbox tests may fail if lightbox UI differs from expectations
- Social sharing/download tests need UI exposure verification
- Accessibility warnings in Lightbox component (non-blocking)

---

## 🚀 Next When You Return

### Immediate Priority (1-2 hours)
**Goal:** Increase test pass rate to 50%+

1. **Add `data-testid` to Components**
   ```svelte
   <!-- PhotoCard.svelte -->
   <article data-testid="photo-card-{photo.id}">

   <!-- PhotoDetailModal.svelte -->
   <div data-testid="photo-modal" role="dialog">
   <button data-testid="modal-close-button">

   <!-- FilterPanel.svelte -->
   <input data-testid="search-input" placeholder="Search...">
   <button data-testid="filter-emotion-{emotion}">

   <!-- AlbumCard.svelte -->
   <article data-testid="album-card-{albumKey}">
   ```

2. **Update Test Selectors**
   ```ts
   // Before
   const photo = page.locator('text=Photo').first();

   // After
   const photo = page.locator('[data-testid^="photo-card-"]').first();
   ```

3. **Run Tests Again**
   ```bash
   npx playwright test --reporter=line
   ```

### Short-term (This Week)
1. Achieve 80%+ test pass rate
2. Fix remaining accessibility violations
3. Add visual regression screenshots for key pages
4. Document testing patterns

### Medium-term (Next Week)
1. Implement Page Object Models
2. Add unit tests for utility functions
3. Performance testing with Lighthouse
4. Complete Phase 6 documentation

## 💡 Tips for Next Session

1. **Start with PhotoCard** - It's the most used component
   - Add `data-testid="photo-card-{photo.id}"`
   - Add `data-testid="photo-image"` to image
   - Add `data-testid="favorite-button"` to heart button

2. **Test Incrementally** - Don't add all IDs at once
   - Add IDs to one component
   - Run related tests
   - Verify improvements
   - Repeat

3. **Check Test Output** - Very verbose and helpful
   - Screenshots show what went wrong
   - Error messages indicate which selectors failed
   - Use `--headed` mode to watch tests run

4. **Focus on High-Value Tests First**
   - Homepage navigation (most important UX)
   - Photo browsing (core feature)
   - Favorites (user engagement)

---

## 🎉 Wins This Session

- **64 comprehensive tests** written and documented
- **Accessibility issues** found and fixed proactively
- **Test infrastructure** fully operational
- **Clear roadmap** for test improvement
- **Everything committed** and safe

---

## ❓ Questions to Consider

When you return, think about:

1. Should we add visual regression testing? (Playwright has built-in screenshot comparison)
2. Do we need cross-browser testing? (Currently Chromium only)
3. Should we add mobile viewport tests?
4. Do we want to test with actual Supabase data or mocks?

**Great stopping point!** The foundation is solid, next session will be iterative improvement. 🚀
