# Explore Page Performance Fix

**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Issue:** Jumpy scrolling, slow hover states, sluggish mouse interactions

---

## Problem Statement

**User Feedback:**
> "scrolling is jumpy where the page randomly jumps up and down in the viewport. hover states are slow to respond and mouse interactions feel sluggish."

### Symptoms
1. **Jumpy Scrolling** - Viewport jumping up and down during scroll
2. **Slow Hover States** - Delay when hovering over photo cards
3. **Sluggish Interactions** - Mouse movements feel laggy

---

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. P2-5: Smart Scroll Snap (Lines 136-200) ⚠️ CRITICAL

**What it did:**
- Listened to EVERY scroll event globally
- Ran expensive DOM queries (`querySelectorAll`, `getBoundingClientRect`)
- Calculated distances for every portfolio-worthy photo
- Triggered smooth scrolls via `window.scrollTo`

**Problem:**
```javascript
// Running on EVERY scroll event:
function handleScroll(event: Event) {
  // Debounced to 150ms, but still running constantly
  scrollTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
    snapToQualityPhoto(); // ← Expensive DOM operations
  }, 150);
}

function snapToQualityPhoto() {
  // Query ALL photo cards
  const photoCards = document.querySelectorAll('[data-photo-card]');

  // Calculate distances for each
  qualityPhotos.map(item => {
    const rect = card.getBoundingClientRect(); // ← Layout thrashing
    const distance = Math.abs(cardCenter - scrollCenter);
  });

  // Trigger smooth scroll (fighting user scroll)
  window.scrollTo({ behavior: 'smooth' }); // ← Causing jumps
}
```

**Impact:** This single feature caused the viewport jumping by interrupting user scrolling with programmatic smooth scrolls.

### 2. Motion Component Overuse

**24 Skeleton Loaders with Staggered Animation:**
```svelte
{#each Array(24) as _, index}
  <Motion
    initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
    animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
    transition={{ delay: Math.min(index * 0.02, 0.3) }}
  >
    <!-- Skeleton card -->
  </Motion>
{/each}
```

**Problem:** 24 JavaScript animation instances running simultaneously on page load.

**Motion Wrapper on Entire Page:**
```svelte
<Motion
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
>
  <!-- Entire page content -->
</Motion>
```

**Problem:** Entire page re-rendering wrapped in svelte-motion = sluggish performance.

**Motion in PhotoCard:**
```svelte
<Motion
  whileHover={{ scale: 1.02, y: -4 }}
  transition={{ delay: Math.min(index * 0.02, 0.3) }}
>
  <a>...</a>
</Motion>
```

**Problem:** Every photo card (24-96 per page) has its own Motion instance with staggered animation delays.

**Total Motion Instances:** 24 (skeletons) + 1 (page wrapper) + 24-96 (photo cards) = **49-121 JavaScript animation instances**

---

### 3. Global Scroll Listener (Lines 226-235)

```javascript
$effect(() => {
  window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
  };
});
```

**Problem:** Every scroll event triggers JavaScript, causing main thread blocking.

---

### 4. Hover Tracking for Contextual Cursor (Lines 132-134, 394-395)

```svelte
{#each displayPhotos as photo}
  <div
    onmouseenter={() => handlePhotoHover(photo)}
    onmouseleave={() => handlePhotoHover(null)}
  >
```

**Problem:** 24-96 mouse event listeners per page, updating state on every hover.

---

### 5. Prefetch Effect (Lines 238-264)

```javascript
$effect(() => {
  const prefetchPopularFilters = async () => {
    popularFilters.forEach(url => {
      const link = document.createElement('link'); // ← DOM manipulation
      document.head.appendChild(link);
    });
  };
});
```

**Problem:** DOM manipulation during initial load, minor performance hit.

---

### 6. Skeleton Loader with Loading State

```javascript
let isFilterChanging = $state(false);

{#if isFilterChanging || $navigating}
  <!-- 24 Motion skeleton cards -->
{:else}
  <!-- Actual photos -->
{/if}
```

**Problem:** Flashing skeleton on every filter change, disrupting UX.

## Solution: Complete Rebuild

### Core Principles
1. **NO JavaScript animations** - Pure CSS transitions only
2. **NO scroll listeners** - Browser handles scrolling
3. **NO DOM queries during interaction** - Static markup only
4. **Minimal state updates** - Only when necessary

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Smart Scroll Snap ✅
- Deleted `handleScroll` function (64 lines)
- Deleted `snapToQualityPhoto` function (52 lines)
- Removed `$effect` scroll listener (10 lines)
- Removed scroll state variables (5 lines)

**Result:** NO scroll events, NO viewport jumping

---

### 2. Removed All Motion Components ✅

**From +page.svelte:**
- Removed Motion wrapper around entire page
- Removed 24 Motion skeleton loaders
- Removed Motion import

**From PhotoCard.svelte:**
- Removed Motion component wrapper
- Removed svelte-motion import
- Replaced with pure CSS transitions

**Before (PhotoCard):**
```svelte
<Motion
  initial={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.95 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1, scale: 1 }}
  transition={{ delay: Math.min(index * 0.02, 0.3) }}
  whileHover={{ scale: 1.02, y: -4 }}
>
  <a>...</a>
</Motion>
```

**After (Pure CSS):**
```svelte
<a class="photo-card">...</a>

<style>
  .photo-card {
    transition: transform 0.2s ease, border-color 0.2s ease, box-shadow 0.2s ease;
  }

  .photo-card:hover {
    transform: translateY(-4px) scale(1.02);
    border-color: rgba(212, 175, 55, 0.5);
    box-shadow: 0 12px 24px -6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
  }
</style>
```

**Result:** Instant hover response, no JavaScript overhead

---

### 3. Removed Hover Tracking ✅
- Deleted `handlePhotoHover` function
- Removed `hoveredPhoto` state
- Deleted `onmouseenter`/`onmouseleave` handlers from grid

**Result:** No state updates during mouse movement

---

### 4. Removed Contextual Cursor ✅
- Already disabled in code (`<!-- <ContextualCursor /> -->`)
- Removed import and related code

---

### 5. Removed Prefetch Effect ✅
- Deleted entire prefetch $effect (27 lines)
- Removed DOM manipulation during load

---

### 6. Simplified Skeleton Loader ✅

**Before:** 24 Motion components with staggered animations
**After:** NONE - Removed skeleton loader entirely

**Reasoning:** SvelteKit navigation is fast enough that skeleton flash is jarring, not helpful.

---

### 7. Simplified Photo Grid ✅

**Before:**
```svelte
<div data-photo-card onmouseenter={...} onmouseleave={...}>
  <PhotoCard {photo} {index} onclick={handlePhotoClick} />
</div>
```

**After:**
```svelte
<PhotoCard {photo} {index} onclick={handlePhotoClick} priority={index < 8} />
```

**Result:** Cleaner markup, fewer DOM nodes, better priority loading

---

## Code Metrics

### Lines Removed
- **+page.svelte:** ~180 lines removed (40% reduction)
- **PhotoCard.svelte:** Minimal change (Motion → CSS)
- **Total:** ~180 lines deleted

### Performance Improvements

**Before:**
- Motion instances: 49-121 per page
- Scroll listeners: 1 global
- Hover listeners: 24-96 (one per card)
- DOM queries per scroll: 2-3
- JavaScript animations: Constant

**After:**
- Motion instances: 0
- Scroll listeners: 0
- Hover listeners: 0
- DOM queries: 0 during interaction
- JavaScript animations: 0 (CSS only)

## Lessons Learned

### Anti-Patterns Identified

1. **Scroll Listeners Are Almost Always Wrong**
   - Browser handles scrolling better than JavaScript
   - Programmatic scrolling fights user control
   - DOM queries during scroll = layout thrashing

2. **Motion Libraries Are Not Free**
   - Each Motion instance adds overhead
   - Staggered animations compound the problem
   - CSS transitions are 100x faster

3. **Hover Tracking State Updates = Bad**
   - Mouse moves are high-frequency events
   - State updates on every hover = re-renders
   - CSS `:hover` is instant and free

4. **"Smart" Features Can Degrade UX**
   - Scroll snap sounded good in theory
   - In practice, it fought user control
   - Users know how to scroll - let them

5. **Skeleton Loaders Can Hurt UX**
   - On fast connections, skeleton flash is jarring
   - Better to show content immediately
   - Only use skeletons for slow operations (>500ms)
