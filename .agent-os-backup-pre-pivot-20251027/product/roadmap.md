# Product Roadmap

## Overview

**Last Updated:** October 18, 2025

This roadmap outlines the phased development of **The Living Archive**, organized into 4 strategic phases that build incrementally from foundation to signature experiences. Each phase includes specific deliverables, success criteria, and persona alignment.

**Current Status:** Phase 1 ‚úÖ Complete | Phase 2 üöß In Progress (Gallery Lobby active)

### Market Validation (October 2025)

Competitive analysis of 500px, Flickr, and SmugMug confirmed our strategic differentiation:
- ‚úÖ **Emotion-first discovery** doesn't exist in competitor galleries
- ‚úÖ **AI narrative detection** (game-winning rallies, comeback stories) is unique
- ‚úÖ **Quality stratification** with visual indicators not available elsewhere
- ‚úÖ **Physics-based interactions** differentiate from static grid UX

**Validated Implementation:** `/explore` page with 6 emotion selectors + 5 curated collections proves market gap. Story Curation Engine (6 narrative algorithms) further establishes unique position.

**Strategic Priority:** Gallery Lobby as hub - Featured Stories carousel creates immediate "wow" moment while serving all 3 personas (Explorers, Seekers, Curators).

**Development Strategy:**
- Build foundation systems first (design tokens, data architecture, core interactions)
- Layer intelligent features on solid infrastructure (search, AI curation, collections)
- Add experiential polish incrementally (motion, theming, micro-interactions)
- Deliver signature 3D experience last with strict performance budget

**Performance Constraints:**
- Maintain 60fps animations throughout all phases
- Page load times under 2 seconds
- Virtual scrolling support for 10,000+ photos
- Lighthouse scores 90+ across all metrics

**Design Quality Gates:**
- All phases must adhere to Design Brief (`agent-os/product/design-brief.md`)
- No emojis in UI (Lucide React icons only)
- No flat generic layouts (quality stratification required)
- Design tokens exclusively (no hard-coded colors/spacing)
- Motion tokens for all animations (no arbitrary durations)
- WCAG AAA contrast (7:1 minimum for all text)

**Reference:** See `agent-os/product/design-brief.md` for comprehensive aesthetic principles, anti-patterns, and quality checklists.

Integrates with story viewer for narrative navigation. Component: EmotionTimeline.tsx. `M`

17. [ ] **Momentum Scroll with Smart Snap** ‚Äî Enhance scrolling with Framer Motion useScroll + useSpring for physics-based inertia, velocity detection monitors scroll speed (threshold: 500px/s triggers snap), quality-threshold snap logic identifies portfolio_worthy photos (quality >= 8) in viewport and auto-centers them, progressive friction dampening as velocity decreases, visual snap indicators (subtle glow highlights snap targets), works with virtual scrolling system, respects prefers-reduced-motion (disables snap behavior), mobile optimization with touch gesture integration (@use-gesture/react).

### Deliverables

19. [ ] **3D Emotion Galaxy Core** ‚Äî Build Three.js + React Three Fiber scene rendering 500 curated photos (subset selected by portfolio_worthy + diversity of emotions/play types), photo sprites positioned in 3D space using similarity scoring algorithm (emotion similarity: 30%, play type: 25%, composition: 15%, quality proximity: 15%, time proximity: 10%, color palette: 5%), clusters form naturally based on metadata, lerp-based smooth movement for camera transitions (0.05 lerp factor), OrbitControls for user navigation (zoom limits: 5-50 units, pan limits: ¬±100 units), depth-of-field blur for spatial depth perception (near/far plane adjustments), GPU instanced rendering for performance.

## Implementation Notes

### Strategic Phase Ordering

**Phase 1 (Foundation):** Must be unbreakable. Everything builds on this infrastructure. Invest time in robust database schema, design system, and virtual scrolling performance. Shortcuts here create technical debt that compounds.

**Phase 2 (Intelligence):** Adds high-value utility for Seekers and Curators without requiring advanced interactions. Natural language search and AI-curated collections provide immediate ROI by drastically reducing time-to-find for target photos.

**Phase 3 (Experience):** Layering motion and theming on stable infrastructure ensures interactions enhance rather than hinder usability. Explorers get wow moments, but Seekers/Curators don't lose functionality.

**Phase 4 (Signature):** 3D Galaxy is isolated feature with contained scope. Can ship Phases 1-3 as MVP without it. Strict performance budget prevents feature from degrading overall site quality.

### Cross-Phase Considerations

**Performance Monitoring:**
- Lighthouse CI runs on every deployment (scores must remain 90+)
- Real User Monitoring (RUM) via Sentry tracks Web Vitals in production
- FPS monitoring in development (Chrome DevTools frame rate overlay)
- Bundle size tracking with @next/bundle-analyzer (main bundle <200KB gzipped)

**Accessibility:**
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required across all phases
- Keyboard navigation tested in every component
- Screen reader testing with VoiceOver/NVDA for critical paths
- Reduced motion support (respects prefers-reduced-motion media query)
- Color contrast validation (minimum 4.5:1 ratio for text)

**Testing Strategy:**
- Playwright E2E tests for user journeys (Explorer, Seeker, Curator paths)
- Visual regression tests for UI consistency (screenshot comparisons)
- Performance regression tests (Lighthouse scores, animation frame rates)
- Unit tests for complex algorithms (story detection, similarity scoring)
- Manual QA for motion interactions (physics feel, timing)

**Data & Content:**
- Work with production dataset (20,000 photos across 200+ albums)
- AI enrichment runs on representative sample (1,000 photos minimum)
- Test edge cases (albums with <10 photos, missing metadata, all same emotion)
- Performance testing at scale (grids with 10,000+ photos)

### Future Phases (Post-Launch)

**Phase 5: Mobile Optimization & PWA**
- Touch gesture support (@use-gesture/react integration)
- Mobile-specific UI adaptations (simplified orbs, bottom sheets)
- Progressive Web App (PWA) configuration (offline support, install prompt)
- iOS/Android native-like experiences

**Phase 6: Collaboration & User Accounts**
- Athlete/Coach accounts with personal dashboards
- Custom collection creation and sharing
- Photo favoriting and commenting
- Team galleries with role-based access

**Phase 7: Monetization & Print Shop**
- Print fulfillment integration (WHCC, Bay Photo, Printique)
- Payment processing (Stripe)
- Commission splitting (photographer/platform)
- Order tracking and customer service workflows

**Phase 8: Analytics & Insights**
- Photographer dashboard with engagement metrics
- Conversion funnel analysis (view ‚Üí favorite ‚Üí download ‚Üí purchase)
- Heatmaps showing photo interaction patterns
- A/B testing framework for feature optimization

### Technology Choices Rationale

**Framer Motion vs. GSAP:** Use Framer Motion for React component animations (declarative, layout animations), GSAP for complex timelines and scroll-triggered effects (more control, better performance for timeline scrubbing).

**Supabase vs. Custom Backend:** Supabase provides PostgreSQL with pgvector for semantic search, real-time subscriptions, edge functions, and authentication out-of-the-box. Faster development than custom Node.js backend.

**Three.js vs. Babylon.js:** Three.js has larger ecosystem, better React integration (@react-three/fiber), more examples for photo sprite rendering. Adequate for 500-photo scene with proper optimization.

**Pinecone vs. Weaviate:** Pinecone's managed service eliminates devops overhead, excellent documentation, predictable pricing. Semantic search isn't core differentiator, so prefer ease of integration.

**@tanstack/react-virtual vs. react-window:** Tanstack Virtual has better TypeScript support, more flexible API, supports dynamic row heights, active maintenance. Worth migration from react-window.
