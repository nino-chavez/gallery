   ```html
   <meta name="google-site-verification" content="YOUR_CODE_HERE" />
   ```

2. Add to your site's `<head>` section:
   ```bash
   # Edit: src/routes/+layout.svelte
   # Add inside <svelte:head> block
   ```

   ```svelte
   <svelte:head>
     <!-- Existing meta tags -->

     <!-- Google Search Console Verification -->
     <meta name="google-site-verification" content="YOUR_CODE_HERE" />
   </svelte:head>
   ```

3. Deploy the change to Vercel
4. Return to Search Console and click **Verify**

**Expected time:** 2 minutes + deployment time

   - **Host:** `@` or leave blank
   - **Value:** (paste the verification code)
   - **TTL:** Automatic or 1 hour

4. Wait 5-10 minutes for DNS propagation
5. Return to Search Console and click **Verify**

## üîç Troubleshooting Common Issues

### **Issue: "Sitemap couldn't be read"**

**Causes:**

**Fix:**
```bash
# 1. Test sitemap in browser
curl https://photography.ninochavez.co/sitemap.xml

# 2. Validate XML
# Paste sitemap content into: https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/validate-xml-sitemap.html

# 3. Check robots.txt allows crawling
curl https://photography.ninochavez.co/robots.txt
# Should see: User-agent: * / Allow: /
```

---

### **Issue: "Discovered but not indexed"**

**Causes:**
- Google is still crawling (be patient)
- Low crawl budget (too many URLs at once)
- Duplicate content
- Low-quality content

**Fix:**
1. **Wait 2-4 weeks** - Google indexes gradually
2. **Check duplicate content** - Make sure each photo URL has unique meta descriptions
3. **Improve content quality** - Add descriptive captions to more photos
4. **Request indexing** - Use URL Inspection tool for high-priority pages

---

### **Issue: "Indexed but not appearing in search"**

**Causes:**
- Not ranking yet (new site)
- Low search volume for exact keywords
- Competition from established sites

**Fix:**
1. **Target long-tail keywords** - "Nino Chavez volleyball photography" instead of "volleyball photos"
2. **Build backlinks** - Share URLs on social media, forums, your main site
3. **Add more content** - Blog posts about photography, event recaps
4. **Be patient** - SEO takes 3-6 months to show results
