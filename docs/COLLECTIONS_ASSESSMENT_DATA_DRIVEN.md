1. **Sunset Sessions** - 10,562 photos (53.06%) ‚ö†Ô∏è **TOO BROAD**

   - Recommendation: Keep as-is (this is your showcase)

5. **Defensive Masterclass** - 2,698 photos (13.55%) ‚úÖ **GOOD**

### ‚ùå **Empty Collections** (1 out of 10)

10. **Early Game Energy** - 0 photos (0.00%) ‚ùå **MUST REMOVE**
   - No photos match criteria
   - Recommendation: **Remove immediately**

## Critical Issues

### 1. **Sunset Sessions is Too Broad** (53% of photos!)
- **Problem:** "Evening" time_of_day matches 10,562 photos - over half your portfolio
- **Impact:** Not a curated collection, it's too generic
- **Solutions:**
  - Option A: Narrow criteria (add composition_score ‚â•8, or emotional_impact ‚â•7)
  - Option B: Rename to "Evening Competition" and accept it's broad
  - Option C: Split into "Sunset Sessions" (evening + high composition) and "Evening Action" (broader)

### 2. **Overlap Analysis**

**Golden Hour vs Sunset:**
- Golden Hour: 271 photos (1.36%) - specific lighting condition
- Sunset: 10,562 photos (53%) - broad evening category
- **Conclusion:** These are NOT overlapping - Golden Hour is a subset of Sunset, but serves different purpose
- **Recommendation:** Keep both, but clarify Sunset is broader

**Aerial Artistry vs Defensive Masterclass:**
- Aerial: 3,363 photos (attack/block, high quality)
- Defensive: 2,698 photos (dig/block, good quality)
- **Overlap:** Both include "block" play_type
- **Conclusion:** Some overlap but different focuses (aerial vs defensive saves)
- **Recommendation:** Keep both, they serve different narratives
