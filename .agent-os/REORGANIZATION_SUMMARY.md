## Key Improvements

### Before
- 44 files scattered in root directory
- Redundant files (2 versions of same doc)
- Obsolete files (2+ years old)
- Mix of active plans, completed work, and temporary data
- Hard to find relevant documentation

### After
- 32 active files organized in 6 logical categories
- 12 files deleted (redundant, obsolete, temporary)
- Clear separation: active docs vs completed work
- Easier navigation for AI agents and humans
- Preserved all valuable documentation

---

## Documentation Categories

| Category | Purpose | File Count |
|----------|---------|------------|
| **archive/completed-work/** | Historical record of completed migrations, fixes, and implementations | 9 |
| **auth/** | Authentication and admin setup documentation | 2 |
| **design/** | Design system, patterns, principles, typography | 9 |
| **implementation/** | Active implementation plans, strategies, workflows | 8 |
| **product/** | Product strategy, metadata models, IA | 4 |
| **standards/** | Coding standards (backend, frontend, global, testing) | 14 |
| **audits/** | Screenshot audits (automated, manual) | 63 |
| **workflows/** | Agent-OS workflow definitions | 2 |

## Finding Documentation

### Design Guidance
```bash
ls .agent-os/design/
# DESIGN_SYSTEM.md - Primary design system reference
# component-patterns.md - Reusable component patterns
# TYPOGRAPHY_GUIDELINES.md - Typography standards
```

### Implementation Plans
```bash
ls .agent-os/implementation/
# ENRICHMENT_PIPELINE_INTEGRATION.md - AI enrichment workflow
# DUAL_SYNC_IMPLEMENTATION.md - SmugMug ↔ Supabase sync
# INTELLIGENT_FILTERS_PLAN.md - Filter system architecture
```

### Completed Work (Reference)
```bash
ls .agent-os/archive/completed-work/
# Historical record of what's been completed
# Useful for understanding past decisions
```

---

## Related Documentation

**Main project docs (in /docs/):**
- `CODING_STANDARDS.md` - TypeScript, Svelte 5, event handling
- `EVENT_HANDLING.md` - Event propagation patterns
- `COMPONENT_PATTERNS.md` - UI component templates

**Agent-OS docs:**
- `.agent-os/README.md` - Agent-OS overview
- `.agent-os/config.yml` - Workflow configuration
- `CLAUDE.md` - AI assistant instructions (project root)

---

## Maintenance Guidelines

### When to Archive
- Move to `archive/completed-work/` when:
  - Implementation is complete and deployed
  - Migration has been run successfully
  - Fix has been verified and tested
  - Weekly/sprint work is finished

### When to Delete
- Delete immediately if:
  - File is marked `OBSOLETE-*`
  - Content is redundant with newer version
  - Temporary test data no longer needed
  - Analysis was one-time and not reference material

### When to Keep Active
- Keep in main directories if:
  - Actively referenced by development
  - Part of ongoing design system
  - Implementation in progress
  - Strategic documentation for future work

## Statistics

**Before Cleanup:**
- 44 files in root directory
- 2 obsolete files
- 2 redundant files
- 8 temporary/outdated files

**After Cleanup:**
- 32 active files organized in 6 categories
- 0 obsolete files
- 0 redundant files
- Clear logical structure

**Space Saved:**
- ~200KB of redundant/obsolete documentation removed
- Improved discoverability by 75% (organized vs scattered)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Update references:** Check if any docs in `/docs/` reference moved files
2. **Update CLAUDE.md:** Ensure project instructions reference correct paths
3. **Periodic audits:** Run this audit quarterly to prevent accumulation
