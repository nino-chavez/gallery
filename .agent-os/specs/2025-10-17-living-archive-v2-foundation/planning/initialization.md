## User Request

User requested to proceed with the v2 implementation following the comprehensive planning documents:
- Design Brief (agent-os/product/design-brief.md)
- Product Mission (agent-os/product/mission.md)
- Product Roadmap (agent-os/product/roadmap.md)
- Tech Stack (agent-os/product/tech-stack.md)

**Key Requirements:**
