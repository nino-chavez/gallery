## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### Check 8: Standards Alignment ✅

**Status:** PASSED WITH NOTES

**Global Standards:**

**Tech Stack (agent-os/standards/global/tech-stack.md):**
- ⚠️ Standard document is placeholder template (not blocking)
- ✅ Spec defines complete tech stack:
  - Framework: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript 5.8
  - Frontend: Tailwind CSS 4, Framer Motion, GSAP, Three.js
  - Backend: Supabase (preserved), SmugMug API (preserved)
  - Testing: Playwright (E2E + visual regression)
  - Package Manager: pnpm (required)
- ✅ Tech stack matches CLAUDE.md development guide
- ✅ No conflicts detected

**Testing Standards (agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md):**
- ✅ "Write Minimal Tests During Development" - Spec follows this (2-8 tests per phase)
- ✅ "Test Only Core User Flows" - Spec specifies strategic coverage only
- ✅ "Defer Edge Case Testing" - Spec avoids exhaustive edge case testing

---

## Critical Issues

**NONE FOUND**

---

## Minor Issues

### 1. Visual Assets Directory Empty ⚠️

**Issue:** `planning/visuals/` directory exists but contains no files

**Impact:** LOW - Not blocking

**Rationale:**
- Design system is code-defined through motion tokens, emotion palette, CSS custom properties
- Comprehensive written specifications provide all necessary guidance
- Component visual specifications detailed in spec
- No visual mockups needed for implementation

**Recommendation:** No remediation needed. Consider adding visual examples in future for marketing/documentation purposes, but not required for implementation.

### 2. Tech Stack Standard Document Placeholder ⚠️

**Issue:** `agent-os/standards/global/tech-stack.md` contains placeholder template

**Impact:** LOW - Not blocking

**Rationale:**
- Spec contains complete tech stack definition
- CLAUDE.md documents tech stack comprehensively
- No ambiguity about technology choices
- Implementation has clear guidance

**Recommendation:** Update placeholder with actual tech stack after Phase 1 completion for documentation consistency.

---

## Over-Engineering Concerns

**NONE DETECTED**

The specification is appropriately scoped:
- ✅ Frontend-only reimplementation (no backend modifications)
- ✅ Backend preservation strategy clear
- ✅ No unnecessary component creation
- ✅ No duplicated backend logic
- ✅ All features map to user requirements
- ✅ Test writing limited to strategic coverage (18-47 tests total across all phases)
- ✅ Quality gates prevent feature creep
- ✅ Performance budgets enforce constraints

---

## Recommendations

### 1. Proceed to Implementation (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Status:** READY

The specification is comprehensive, well-structured, and aligned with all requirements. All quality gates are in place. No blocking issues found.

**Action:** Begin Phase 0 (Project Setup & Initialization)

### 2. Update Tech Stack Standard Post-Phase 1 (LOW PRIORITY)

**Context:** `agent-os/standards/global/tech-stack.md` is currently a placeholder template

**Action:** After Phase 1 completion, populate tech-stack.md with:
- Framework: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript 5.8
- Styling: Tailwind CSS 4
- Animation: Framer Motion 12, GSAP 3, Three.js
- Data: SWR 2, @tanstack/react-virtual
- Icons: Lucide React
- Testing: Playwright
- Package Manager: pnpm

**Timeline:** After Phase 1 validation

### 3. Consider Visual Documentation for Future Marketing (OPTIONAL)

**Context:** No visual mockups exist, but design system is code-defined

**Action:** After implementation, consider creating visual documentation:
- Design system showcase (motion tokens, emotion palette, components)
- User journey flow diagrams
- 3D Galaxy preview screenshots
- Portfolio/case study assets

**Timeline:** Post-launch, not blocking implementation
