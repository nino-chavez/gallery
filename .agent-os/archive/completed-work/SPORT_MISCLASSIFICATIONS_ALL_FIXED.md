## Audit Process

### Step 1: Initial Pattern Detection
User reported visible issues from screenshot (dog, bowling albums).

### Step 2: Comprehensive Audit
Created [scripts/audit-all-album-sports.ts](../scripts/audit-all-album-sports.ts) to list ALL 254 albums with their sport assignments.

### Step 3: Pattern Expansion
Updated [scripts/fix-sport-misclassifications.ts](../scripts/fix-sport-misclassifications.ts) with comprehensive patterns:
- Basketball events
- Golf tournaments
- Tennis matches
- Graduation ceremonies
- Homecoming events
- Senior nights/signing days
- Drama performances
- Bowling
- Pickleball
- Cross country
- Pets/animals

### Step 4: Automated Fix
Ran automated fix script, updating 2,658 photos across 32 albums.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Were These Misclassified?

**1. Event Overlap** (Most Common)
- Homecoming volleyball games → AI saw "volleyball" in context, missed it was a special event
- Senior night volleyball → AI focused on sport, not ceremony aspect
- Graduation with sports themes → AI confused sports context with sport classification

**2. Visual Similarity**
- Basketball courts vs volleyball courts → Similar indoor gym environments
- Golf/Tennis → Outdoor sports with similar camera angles
- Drama (costumes) → Confused with team uniforms

**3. Multi-Sport Events**
- "ACC Fall Sports Picture Day" → Contains volleyball but is portrait session
- "Homecoming Powderpuff" → Contains football but was marked volleyball

**4. Insufficient Context**
- AI models lack album-level context (only analyze individual photos)
- Album names not used in classification
- No validation against album metadata

---

## Prevention Strategies

### Immediate (Implemented)
- ✅ **Detection script** - Can be run anytime to find new issues
- ✅ **Fix script** - Automated correction of detected issues
- ✅ **Comprehensive patterns** - Covers 12+ categories of misclassification

### Short-term (Recommended)
- [ ] **Pre-upload validation** - Check album names before AI enrichment
- [ ] **Confidence scores** - Flag low-confidence classifications for review
- [ ] **Album-level AI** - Use album name/context in classification
- [ ] **Human review queue** - Albums with conflicting signals need review

### Long-term (Future Enhancement)
- [ ] **Improved AI prompts** - Provide album context to AI
- [ ] **Multi-pass enrichment** - Photo-level then album-level validation
- [ ] **User reporting** - Allow users to flag incorrect sport assignments
- [ ] **Admin dashboard** - UI for reviewing/correcting classifications

## Next Steps

### Required (Manual)
1. **Refresh materialized view** in Supabase SQL Editor:
   ```sql
   REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW albums_summary;
   ```

2. **Verify album pills** on `/albums` page
   - Basketball albums should show Basketball pill
   - Graduation/Homecoming should show Portrait pill
   - Golf/Tennis/Bowling should show Other pill (or no pill)

### Recommended
- [ ] Schedule monthly audit runs
- [ ] Document correct sport categories for edge cases
- [ ] Consider adding "event" as a sport category (for graduations, signings, etc.)
- [ ] Add sport_type validation to upload pipeline
