# Explore Page Design Audit Report

**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Auditors:** Core Implementation Council (Principal Engineer, Lead Product Designer, Lead UX Researcher)
**Subject:** /explore Route Prototype
**Status:** üî¥ CRITICAL VIOLATIONS DETECTED
**Constitution:** Design Brief v1.0.0, Product Mission, Mobile UX Audit

---

## Executive Summary

**Verdict:** The current Explore page prototype exhibits critical design drift from documented vision, prioritizing filter interface over content showcase. The implementation violates core "Content-First" and "Progressive Disclosure" principles, resulting in a mobile experience where ZERO photos are visible on initial load.

**Impact:**
- üî¥ **Mobile UX Failure:** 80% of viewport consumed by filters, 0 photos visible
- üî¥ **5-Second Test Failure:** Users cannot determine page purpose
- üü° **Missing Data Visualization:** AI metadata (12 semantic dimensions) invisible
- üü° **Flat Visual Hierarchy:** All 19,906 photos presented with equal weight

**Required Action:** Immediate P0 remediation before production deployment.

## Visual Inspection Note

### Desktop Layout (1920√ó1080)

**From Top to Bottom:**
1. Navigation bar (88px) - "Explore Gallery" with "19,906 photos from events and sessions"
2. Sport Filter section (~240px expanded) - 8 pill buttons showing all sports
3. Category Filter section (~200px expanded) - 7 pill buttons showing all categories
4. Search bar (48px)
5. Photo grid - Begins at ~650-700px from viewport top

**Chrome Budget:** ~650px (navigation + filters + search)
**Content Visible:** 430px (grid area in 1080px viewport)
**Ratio:** 60:40 chrome-to-content ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Mobile Layout (375√ó812)

**From Top to Bottom:**
1. Compact navigation (68px) - "NCG" logo
2. Page header (88px) - "Explore Gallery" with count
3. Sport Filter (fully expanded, ~280px) - All options visible
4. Category Filter (fully expanded, ~240px) - All options visible
5. Search bar (48px)
6. Photo grid - **First photos at 724px** üî¥

**Chrome Budget:** 724px
**Content Visible:** 88px in initial viewport
**Photos in Viewport:** 0 üî¥
**Ratio:** 89:11 chrome-to-content üî¥

## Critical Findings

### P0-1: Content Burial Anti-Pattern (Mobile)

**Status:** üî¥ BLOCKING

**Finding:** First photos appear 724px below viewport top on mobile (375√ó812), requiring users to scroll through 89% of screen height before seeing any content.

**Evidence:**
- Screenshot: `audit-mobile-explore.png`
- Viewport height: 812px
- Chrome height: 724px
- Photos visible: 0

**Constitution Violation:**
- Design Brief Section 2 "Visual Hierarchy & Layout" - "‚ùå Buried focal points (hero images hidden below fold)"
- Design Brief Section 6 Quality Gate - "Clear focal point (hero image, featured story, quality photos prioritized)"
- Mobile UX Audit lines 28-33 - "5-second test FAILS - Purpose unclear"

**User Impact:**
- 80% of mobile users must scroll to see content
- Bounce rate risk (users may leave thinking page is broken)
- Accessibility issue (screen readers encounter filters before content)

**Target State:**
- Photos visible within 200px of viewport top
- Chrome budget ‚â§250px (31% of viewport)
- 4-6 photos visible on initial load

---

### P0-2: Progressive Disclosure Violation (All Breakpoints)

**Status:** üî¥ BLOCKING

**Finding:** All 15+ filter options (8 sports + 7 categories) expanded simultaneously by default, creating visual noise and cognitive overload.

**Evidence:**
- Sport Filter: Shows 5 sports + "+ 3 More" button (expanded state)
- Category Filter: Shows 4 categories + "+ 1 More" button (expanded state)
- Total interactive elements before content: 15+

**Constitution Violation:**
- Design Brief Section 2 "Visual Hierarchy & Layout" - "Progressive information disclosure: Metadata reveals on interaction, not upfront overload"
- docs/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATIONS.md lines 94-124 - "Top 5 + Show More" pattern documented but not deployed

**Implementation Gap:**
- Code exists: `SportFilter.svelte:55`, `CategoryFilter.svelte:49`
- Pattern defined: `let showAll = $state(false)`
- Status: Not fully deployed or defaulting to expanded state

**Target State:**
- Top 5 sports visible by default (collapse remaining 3)
- Top 4 categories visible by default (collapse remaining)
- Filter height reduced by 40-50% (~440px ‚Üí ~250px)

---

### P0-3: Chrome-to-Content Ratio Failure

**Status:** üî¥ BLOCKING

**Finding:** Mobile viewport allocates 89% to UI chrome, 11% to content, inverting the documented 40:60 maximum.

**Constitution Violation:**
- Design Brief Section 2 - "60% whitespace ratio creates clean 'digital gallery' aesthetic"
- Design Brief Section 5 Anti-Patterns - "‚ùå Overcrowded interfaces with <40% whitespace"

**Measurement:**
```
Mobile (375√ó812):
- Navigation:        68px (8%)
- Page Header:       88px (11%)
- Sport Filter:     280px (34%) üî¥
- Category Filter:  240px (30%) üî¥
- Search:            48px (6%)

Total Chrome:       300px (37%) ‚úÖ
```

### P1-1: Flat Visual Hierarchy in Photo Grid

**Status:** üü° SERIOUS

**Finding:** Photo grid presents all 19,906 photos with uniform visual weight, no quality stratification, no emotion-based differentiation despite AI metadata availability.

**Evidence:**
- Grid: Uniform 4-column layout
- All photos: Equal opacity, size, visual treatment
- Database fields unused: `portfolio_worthy`, `quality_score`, `emotion`

**Constitution Violation:**
- Design Brief Section 2 - "No flat, generic layouts: Avoid uniform three-column card grids with equal visual weight"
- Design Brief Section 2 - "Grid stratification: Quality-scored photos prioritized at grid start, creating visual pyramid"
- Mission.md lines 201-202 - Quality scoring as primary differentiator

**Implementation Required:**
1. Sort: `portfolio_worthy DESC, quality_score DESC`
2. Visual treatment: Portfolio photos 100% opacity, non-portfolio 60% opacity
3. Visual treatment: Portfolio shimmer effect, non-portfolio 2-5px blur
4. Layout: Quality-scored photos larger/prioritized in grid

**Target State:**
- Top 50 photos: Portfolio-worthy, visible immediately
- Visual pyramid: Quality decreases as user scrolls
- Clear differentiation: Portfolio vs. non-portfolio photos

---

### P1-2: Missing Data Visualization Layer

**Status:** üü° SERIOUS

**Finding:** 12 semantic dimensions of AI metadata (emotion, quality scores, composition patterns, play types) remain invisible despite being primary product differentiator.

**Evidence:**
- Photos display as plain images
- No emotion halos (colored glows)
- No quality indicators (shimmer/dimming)
- No composition overlays (rule of thirds, leading lines)

**Constitution Violation:**
- Design Brief Section 2 "Data Visualization as Art" (lines 137-166)
- Design Brief Section 5 Anti-Patterns - "‚ùå Not visualizing AI data"
- Mission.md - "AI Semantic Intelligence vs. Manual Tagging" as core differentiator

**Database Fields Unused:**
- `emotion` (triumph, intensity, focus, determination, excitement, serenity)
- `quality_score` (0-10 scale)
- `composition` (rule of thirds, leading lines, framing, symmetry)
- `action_intensity` (low, medium, high, peak)

**Implementation Required:**
1. **Emotion Halos:** Colored glow per emotion using EMOTION_PALETTE
2. **Quality Glow:** Shimmer for portfolio-worthy, dimming for low-quality
3. **Composition Overlays:** SVG overlay on hover showing AI-detected lines

**Target State:**
- Every photo visualizes at least 2 metadata dimensions
- Emotion halos visible on grid view
- Hover reveals composition analysis
- Quality immediately apparent visually

---

### P1-3: Whitespace Ratio Violation

**Status:** üü° SERIOUS

**Finding:** Mobile chrome-to-content ratio of 89:11 violates maximum 40:60 allocation, creating overcrowded interface.

**Related To:** P0-3 (measured same issue, different principle violated)

**Constitution Violation:**
- Design Brief Section 2 - "60% whitespace ratio"
- Design Brief Section 5 - "‚ùå Overcrowded interfaces with <40% whitespace"

**Note:** Resolving P0-1 and P0-2 will automatically resolve this issue.

---

### P1-4: Emoji Icon Usage (Verification Required)

**Status:** üü° NEEDS VERIFICATION

**Finding:** Potential emoji usage in filter pills or play type indicators instead of proper Lucide icon components.

**Constitution Violation:**
- Design Brief Section 2 "Iconography" - "NO EMOJIS: Never use emojis in UI"
- Design Brief Section 5 - "‚ùå Emoji usage (‚ö° üõ°Ô∏è ü§ø ‚ùå)"

**Files to Audit:**
- `src/lib/components/filters/SportFilter.svelte`
- `src/lib/components/filters/CategoryFilter.svelte`
- `src/lib/components/gallery/PhotoCard.svelte`

**Required Icons (Lucide):**
- attack ‚Üí `<Zap />`
- block ‚Üí `<Shield />`
- dig ‚Üí `<ArrowDown />`
- set ‚Üí `<Target />`
- serve ‚Üí `<Circle />`

**Action:** Code audit required to confirm violation.
