### After (Versatile + Authoritative)

## Database Schema Enhancement

### Add Sport Taxonomy

**New Field: `sport_type`**
```sql
ALTER TABLE photo_metadata
ADD COLUMN sport_type VARCHAR(50);

-- Possible values:
-- 'volleyball', 'basketball', 'soccer', 'portrait', 'candid', 'track', 'other'
```

**New Field: `photo_category`**
```sql
ALTER TABLE photo_metadata
ADD COLUMN photo_category VARCHAR(50);

-- Possible values:
-- 'action', 'portrait', 'candid', 'celebration', 'warmup', 'ceremony'
```

### Migration Plan for Existing Data

**Step 1:** Default all existing photos to volleyball
```sql
UPDATE photo_metadata
SET sport_type = 'volleyball',
    photo_category = CASE
      WHEN play_type IN ('attack', 'block', 'dig', 'serve', 'set', 'pass') THEN 'action'
      WHEN play_type = 'celebration' THEN 'celebration'
      WHEN play_type = 'timeout' THEN 'candid'
      ELSE 'action'
    END
WHERE sport_type IS NULL;
```

**Step 2:** Manual tagging for non-volleyball photos
- Use AI vision to detect sport type from image content
- Manual review for portrait vs action classification
- Bulk tagging by album name (if album contains "basketball" → tag as basketball)

## TypeScript Type Updates

### Expand `PlayType` to be Sport-Agnostic

**Current (Volleyball-Only):**
```typescript
export type PlayType =
  | 'attack'
  | 'block'
  | 'dig'
  | 'set'
  | 'serve'
  | 'pass'
  | 'celebration'
  | 'timeout'
  | null;
```

**Revised (Multi-Sport):**
```typescript
export type SportType =
  | 'volleyball'
  | 'basketball'
  | 'soccer'
  | 'track'
  | 'softball'
  | 'portrait'
  | 'other';

export type PhotoCategory =
  | 'action'      // Peak athletic moment
  | 'portrait'    // Posed or candid close-up
  | 'candid'      // Between-play moments
  | 'celebration' // Victory, emotion
  | 'warmup'      // Pre-game preparation
  | 'ceremony'    // Awards, recognition
  | 'other';

export type ActionType =
  // Volleyball
  | 'volleyball:attack'
  | 'volleyball:block'
  | 'volleyball:dig'
  | 'volleyball:set'
  | 'volleyball:serve'
  | 'volleyball:pass'
  // Basketball
  | 'basketball:dunk'
  | 'basketball:layup'
  | 'basketball:three-pointer'
  | 'basketball:rebound'
  | 'basketball:defense'
  // Soccer

  | 'soccer:save'
  | 'soccer:pass'
  | 'soccer:tackle'
  // Track
  | 'track:sprint'
  | 'track:hurdles'
  | 'track:relay'
  // Generic
  | 'celebration'
  | 'timeout'
  | null;

export interface PhotoMetadata {
  // ... existing fields ...

  // NEW: Sport taxonomy
  sport_type: SportType;
  photo_category: PhotoCategory;
  action_type: ActionType; // Replaces play_type for multi-sport

  // Existing fields remain compatible
  play_type: ActionType; // Deprecated alias for backward compatibility
}
```

- **Portrait Keywords:** Page 1 for "sports portrait photographer california"
- **Brand Search:** Top 3 for "Nino Chavez sports photographer"
- **Traffic Mix:** 60% volleyball, 25% portrait, 15% other sports

### 6-Month Goals

---

## The Revised "One Thing"

**If you can only do ONE thing this month:**

**Build sport taxonomy into the foundation from day 1.**

Don't hardcode "volleyball" anywhere. Use `sport_type` filtering. Make it easy to expand.

This prevents:
- Volleyball-only SEO pigeonholing
- UI redesigns when adding basketball photos
- Lost opportunities with multi-sport clients
- Appearing one-dimensional

**Every photo URL should support:** `/photo/abc123?sport=volleyball` or `/photo/abc123?category=portrait`

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Volleyball is your flagship, not your prison** - Lead with depth, expand with breadth
2. **Sport-agnostic UI from day 1** - Build for multi-sport even if volleyball dominates
3. **SEO for versatility** - "Sports photographer" > "Volleyball photographer"
4. **Leverage candid portraits** - Differentiates you from pure action shooters
5. **AI metadata works across sports** - Emotion, quality, composition are universal

---

**This positioning overrides volleyball-only assumptions in previous documents.**

**When building features, ask:** "Does this work for basketball photos too?"

If not, make it sport-agnostic.
